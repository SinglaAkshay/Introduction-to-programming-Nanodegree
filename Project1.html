<h1> Heading tags, as the name implies, are tags that are used for the creations of headings.</h1>
<b>  This tag is used for specifying bold text  within the tag.</b><br>
<em> This tag is used to italicize the text found within the tag.</em>
<div> This tag is nothing more than a container unit that encapsulates other page elements and divides the HTML document into sections.</div>
<span> The span tag is like the div tag. It has no meaning at all and is mostly used for styling by using an id or class. The difference between the two is that div is a block element, It's on a seperate line. span however is an inline element, meaning that it can be on a line with other elements.</span>
<p> HTML paragraph tags are used to define the HTML paragraph element. Moreover in this lesson i used to learn how to add a url in any HTML document using <b> anchor </b> tag and how to add an image in any HTML document using <b> img </b> tag. </p>
